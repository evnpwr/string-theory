# String-theory

String theory is an Atom UI theme based on `Nucleus-Dark`. Similarly to Nucleus,
it bases most of the coloring on the syntax theme you use within Atom, and works
best with a dark syntax theme. My personal recommendations for syntax themes are
`seti` or `Base16 Tomorrow Dark`.

## Why ST versus Nucleus?

Nucleus, while a great theme, is quite opinionated. As such, I felt more at ease
forking rather than submitting a pull request. String-theory includes changes to
several sections of the Atom UI, including a slightly cleaner status bar,
tighter font and tab sizing, as well as some better control over gutter display.


## Installing

Installing String-theory is as simple as installing another atom package. You
can either find it via the settings page, or by using `apm`:

```apm install string-theory```
